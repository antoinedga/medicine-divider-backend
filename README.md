# medicine-divider-backend
the backend for a medicine-divider storage, I am creating this as a side project to try and make a better system for managing my grandfather's medicine among my family.
I stopped working on this as  I realized that Apple Health has this same feature and made sure to share with my family about this and how to use it. but this was a fun project to work on
